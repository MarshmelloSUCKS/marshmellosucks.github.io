Bitch I don't know how to read
These phones, they be killin' me
Please, I just know this climate change thing be bigger than me
Snowflakes be whinin' all day
Behavin' (?), you call me a name?
Wife bad, life bad, phone bad, I'm bad, 
Hate that we that thing you hate so much
Can't stop from blamin' us
This meme was just too much
My heart be givin' up
Please dont tell me "shut up"
OK Boomer, that's enough
OK Boomer, that's enough
OK Boomer, listen up, ey

OK Boomer, OK Boomer, aay
OK Boomer, OK Boomer, aay, aay

I hate my life and I hate my wife and I hate my kids too
If only you would understand what I went through
One second, let me make a Facebook post about these phones
I hate when people use them, while I use them to make this post

OK Boomer, OK Boomer, OK Boomer, ey
OK Boomer, OK Boomer, OK Boomer, ey
OK Boomer, OK Boomer, OK Boomer, ey
OK Boomer, OK [gibberish], ey

OK Boomer, OK Boomer, aay
OK Boomer, OK Boomer, aay, aay

[coughing and wheesing]
