    <p><font size=5 face='Courier New' color=white>You are seing this page because we have detected that you have been constantly using the "OwO" and/or "UwU" emoticons.</p>
    <p align=center><font size=6 face=Impact color=white> Why does it matter? OwO ~</font></p>
    <p><font size=5 face='Courier New' color=white></font>It matters because it's fucking annoying, and you're just looking like the world's biggest loser, anyways.</p>
    <p align=center><font size=6 face=Impact color=white> But I can't stop! OwO UwU</font></p>
    <p><font size=5 face='Courier New' color=white></font>Actually, you can. Going to a therapist might help.</font></p>
