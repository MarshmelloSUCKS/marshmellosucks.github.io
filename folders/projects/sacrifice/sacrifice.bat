echo Remember to never let anyone remotely access your PC.
echo Let the story begin...
pause
echo It's a sunny day. Just the right temperature outside. You think to yourself, 'Man, this day is just perfect!'
pause
echo Suddenly, your phone rings.
pause
echo You pick up the phone.
pause
echo A robotic voice tells you that your computer has been reporting viruses to Microsoft and that you should press 1 to connect to technical support.
pause
echo You press 1. After a few seconds, you hear someone with an Indian accent telling you that "your computer has a virus" and that you should "let them connect to your PC".
pause
echo You go over to your PC, still on from last night's work.
pause
echo You tell them that you're at your PC.
pause
echo Tech Support then tells you to "hold down the Windows key and R at the same time".
pause
echo It brings up a box named "Run".
pause
echo They then tell you to type in "www.fastsupport.com".
pause
echo You do that. Suddenly, a page comes up saying "Establish Support Connection".
pause
echo Tech support then gives you a support key.
pause
echo You type the support key and your name in, and press "Continue".
pause
echo After the software downloads, you follow the steps to connect to Tech Support's PC.
pause
echo Once they connect, they go to the Command Prompt and launch "Event viewer".
pause
eventvwr
echo He then tells you that all of the errors are somehow related to the "virus" that you have.
pause
echo He then runs the NETSTAT command.
pause
netstat
echo He then says that all of the IP adresses that show up are "foreign hackers".
pause
echo They then tell you that you're going to have to pay to get the problem fixed.
pause
echo You give them your credit card number.
pause
echo After you pay, Tech Support then transfers over a file called "Virus Removal Tool.exe".
pause
echo They run the file.
pause
echo A command prompt window pops up and lists off what it's "doing".
pause
echo After the software stops running, the Tech Support person types in "syskey" into a Run box. The reason he's running this is "to prevent more viruses from infecting your PC".
pause
echo The scammer declares his work being done, and hangs up the call.
pause
echo You may not know it yet, but the tech support scammer that just "worked" on your PC just locked you out from it, and now your bank account is in the hole thanks to them stealing money. End of machine.
pause
echo And that's how your "perfect day" turned into the worst day you've had so far.
pause
echo End of story.
