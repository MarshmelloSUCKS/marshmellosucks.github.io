  <p align='center'><font face=Times size='5' color=white> Just a heads up before joining Leo Takacs's Discord server to talk about scambaiting, keep this in mind: he raids his own server! Yeah! Someone that raids their own Discord server with @everyone pings and constant nickname changing. His server has gotten to be so shit that two of the admins had left before I did. Now don't go CNN on me, he's not a bad person. He's just super immature. Try saying "Jim Browning is better than you" without getting the message deleted. </p>

<p align=center> So, what will come out of everyone leaving? Probably nothing. If Leo raids his own server regularly, chances are he's not gonna learn anything from this. You're better off just waiting for Jim Browning to make his own server. Also, speaking of Jim, he actually gets numbers shut down, reports scammers to police, and refunds the victims. Yeah, he does shit compared to Leo. I might as well just unsubscribe. Not like I watch him anymore. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p align=center> Oh, by the way, it's deleted now. </p>
