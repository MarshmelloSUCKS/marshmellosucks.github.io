<h4>I'm good at complaining. Whether it be me getting pissed off at something, me tired of hearing something, or just something stupid. Here's some rants about those things that were too short to fit on their own page.</h4>
<div class=moretext>
<h3>Here's a rant about adults, cursive, and Gen Z'ers.</h3>
<p>"You know what's been grinding my gears as of recently? Adults complaining about kids not knowing Cursive. You know how we know stuff? We're taught it. You can't expect us to know something that we weren't taught. Schools don't teach cursive anymore because it's becoming obsolete. Get over it."</p>
</div>
<div class="moretext">
<h3>Here's one about people, anime, and ignorance.</h3>
<p> "Fucking hate how people think "all anime is hentai". Earlier today in Career Skills, someone sitting next to me saw my wallpaper. They immediately cut to "why do you have hentai as your background?" Let me stress something, pal. Not all anime is hentai. By your logic, is Breaking Bad porn? Is Stranger Things porn? Is fucking M*A*S*H porn? I don't think it is. Sure, there is anime that is weird and perverted. However, there are TV shows that are the same way."</p>

<h3>Here's a rant about people not writing out their issue when asking for help.</h3>
<p> "For context, I'm a staff member of two Tech-related Discord servers. Like most Tech Discord servers, we provide software and hardware help. However, we constantly have an issue with people saying "I need help" and not replying after, wondering why their message got ignored. Fuck me, what am I supposed to do? Teleport over to your PC setup? TELL US WHAT'S WRONG SO WE CAN FIX IT. And don't PM us about it. We have channels dedicated to support so more than just one person can help you. Are people like this absolutely retarded or do they not know how to ask for help? Seriously, man." </p>
