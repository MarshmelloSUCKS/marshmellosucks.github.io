            <p>    Aight, so we've all seen the ads. Those ads that portray hackers as people sitting in front of their computers with Command [Prompt] pulled up. Yeah, I just fucking hate those ads so much. They paint people, especially those of us who use Linux (who are basically required to use the command line for certain things) in a negative light, and it's just... I mean, they even paint white hat hackers in a bad light, because... I mean white hat hackers, those are the guys who check for vulnerabilities. Black hat hackers are those who steal your information. But according to the media, all hackers are the same. Even if you're wearing a white hat and you try to make it obvious that you're not a black hat. You don't steal people's information, you protect people from getting their information stolen.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>    And the media absolutely likes to go off the rails and completely make themselves look stupid with anything that comes to tech, especially when it comes to violent video games. They do not cause violence. How many times do we have to day that? Violent video games do not cause violence, and not everyone using a command line is a hacker. Get it fucking right.</p>
