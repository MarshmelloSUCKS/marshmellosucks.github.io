For context, I'm a staff member of two Tech-related Discord servers. Like most Tech Discord servers, we provide software and hardware help. However, we constantly have an issue with people saying "I need help" and not replying after, wondering why their message got ignored. Fuck me, what am I supposed to do? Teleport over to your PC setup? TELL US WHAT'S WRONG SO WE CAN FIX IT. And don't PM us about it. We have channels dedicated to support so more than just one person can help you. Are people like this absolutely retarded or do they not know how to ask for help? Seriously, man.
