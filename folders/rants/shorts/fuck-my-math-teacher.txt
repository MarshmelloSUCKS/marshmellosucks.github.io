I swear to god I hate my math teacher so much

The bitch gives us example after example when all we want is time to do our homework

Oh, and don't you dare assign me "extra credit" stuff when I already know how to do the shit. All you're doing is adding more repetition to an already repetitive class and all that will do is make me hate you more. Just let me browse Twitter in peace.

Also, why the FUCK can't I change to a different math teacher? If I hate who I have, I should be able to switch to someone who doesn't suck ass at teaching.
