            <p>I'm good at complaining. Whether it be me getting pissed off at something, me tired of hearing something, or just something stupid. Here's some rants about those things that were too short to fit on their own page.</p>

            <p>Here's a rant about adults, cursive, and Gen Z'ers.</p>
            <p>"You know what's been grinding my gears as of recently? Adults complaining about kids not knowing Cursive. You know how we know stuff? We're taught it. You can't expect us to know something that we weren't taught. Schools don't teach cursive anymore because it's becoming obsolete. Get over it."</p>

            <p> Here's one about people, anime, and ignorance.</p>
            <p> "Fucking hate how people think "all anime is hentai". Earlier today in Career Skills, someone sitting next to me saw my <a href="/folders/wallpapers/I%20swear%20I'm%20not%20a%20weeb.jpg">wallpaper</a>. They immediately cut to "why do you have hentai as your background?" Let me stress something, pal. Not all anime is hentai. By your logic, is Breaking Bad porn? Is Stranger Things porn? Is fucking M*A*S*H porn? I don't think it is. Sure, there is hentai that is weird and perverted. However, there are TV shows that are the same way.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Good fucking god I swear. And people wonder why they don't want to talk about shit like that. Fucking ignorance."</p>
