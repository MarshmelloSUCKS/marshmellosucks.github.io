Fucking hate how people think "all anime is hentai". Earlier today in Career Skills, someone sitting next to me saw my wallpaper (it's /folders/wallpapers/I%20swear%20I'm%20not%20a%20weeb.jpg). They immediately cut to "why do you have hentai as your background?" Let me stress something, pal. Not all anime is hentai. By your logic, is Breaking Bad porn? Is Stranger Things porn? Is fucking M*A*S*H porn? I don't think it is. Sure, there is hentai that is weird and perverted. However, there are TV shows that are the same way.

Good fucking god I swear. And people wonder why they don't want to talk about shit like that. Fucking ignorance.
