                <p><b>Christianity summed up in a <a href="https://twitter.com/IowanEASFan/status/1190827746764738560">tweet</a>: <i>"If it's apparently God who gave you a disease, why pray to him to remove it if he gave you it in the first place? It was his plan for you to become sick, after all."</i></b></p>
                <p>    I know what you guys are going to say: "are you fucking crazy? Christianity isn't a cult!" Believe it or not, I provide the reasoning as to why I think what's in the title. Anyways, let's get on with it.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p> Last Sunday (2019/10/27), I had to go to church. They had this whole reformation bullshit and my cousin was getting "reformed". While I was there, I had to attend the hour-long torture of listening to a pastor ramble on about the "babble" (credit to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mikeygleasoncats">Michael Mikey</a> for that one) and how Jesus, our "lord and savior" did a bunch of shit. Trust me, I forgot all about it. It doesn't help that I spent 30 minutes "taking a shit". However, I was able to sneak out the pamphlet and a picture of a poster there.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>    Anyways, about the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/GltKzhA">pamphlet</a>. The pamphlet didn't have the juicy stuff in it,but I'm going to highlight some of the things that strike me as "shit that belongs in a cult" about it. From Psalm 84:1-7 on the 3rd page, it reads: </p>
            </div>
            <div class="img">
                <p>
                    "My soul longs, indeed it faints for the courts of the LORD, my heart and flesh sing for joy to the living God."
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>First off, how can your flesh and heart sing? Last time I heard, they can't talk by themselves. And how can you sing to "the living God" when said God died LONG AGO?</p>
                <p>Now I'm going to talk about the whole reformation shit. The pastor walked up to the kids, placed her arm on their shoulder, read some shit like she had the power of God Jesus by her side, and moved onto the next one. That kinda strikes me as creepy in a way. You have an adult placing their hand on a 14 year old, reading some religious bullshit. And before you say, "but it's a priest!", <a href="/folders/assets/rant-christianity-cult/links.html">let me highlight how oh-so-trustworthy priests are</a>.</p>
                <p>And now, the <a href="/folders/assets/rant-christianity-cult/poster.jpg">poster</a>. Probably the most damning thing of all that I captured. As you can read from 1 and 2, this thing REALLY wants you to love God. More than your own fucking family, apparently. Need I say how wrong it is that you put something that doesn't exist in front of your own family that, by the way, will be by your side, and has been for the past decade or more? Sorry, but I actually respect my family. Not some fake being.</p>
                <p>Another thing I'd like to point out: why do you think the Bible is such a big ass thing? It's a religious book, yes, but it's a book. A very outdated book, I'd like to point out. It says you should throw children against the wall if they disobey you, that homosexuality is the worst thing ever, you don't deserve heaven if your balls have gotten kicked, deformed people can't approach God, non-virgins are to be stoned, you need to bang your brother's wife if he dies, <b>women are inferior to men</b>, and other shit like that. <sup>(<a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/bible-passages-against-believers/ivana-wynn">src</a>)</sup></p>
                <p>TL:DR - After attending church last Sunday, I've come away thinking it's a cult experience.</p>
