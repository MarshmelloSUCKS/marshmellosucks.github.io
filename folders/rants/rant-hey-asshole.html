                <p>    Hey, asshole. I bet you're really happy right now, fucking around with people because of shit that happened years ago. I bet you're happy taking shit out on other people who don't really deserve it. I bet you're really happy with those crooked ass teeth of yours, smiling down at those you've emotionally fucked. Yeah, I'm talking about you. Mr. Perfect. Mr. I don't bully anyone. Mr. "Quit fucking swearing!". My God, you really are a character. I am so ready to punch you in the face, possibly knocking out a tooth or two. I want you to experience physically what I've been experiencing emotionally.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p> And I know, you're going to bring up "but you say everyone sucks but you!" Only half of that is true. I have most definetly drug myself down more than anyone else. I might say you suck when you miss a ball, but know we're just doing it for fun. I'm not saying you won't get anywhere in life by missing a ball in Phys Ed. I am saying that you won't get anywhere by raping me emotionally because I was "gay" in 6th grade. I'll let you know I wasn't even gay at all. "But you said you're not gay anymore!" I did say that. That's because I was in the heat of the moment, not knowing what was going to be said next or how to respond. I bet you've had those moments too. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>    So, instead of fucking me constantly, how about you ram your dick up someone else's ass? How about taking shit out on your non-existent friends? How about you pick on someone that isn't me? I've been harassed enough. It's time for you to shut the fuck up before I have a mental breakdown- or worse.
