        <!--Body Text--><div class="text">
            <p>    Before I rant about this, you guys are going to need some context. I have been assigned to clean some entryways in the school every Tuesday and Thursday. Doesn't sound like an issue, right? Well, I didn't sign up for this shit. I walked in blind to all of this when school started a couple weeks ago. I was with my bitchy adviser last year (let's refer to her as BA) and she managed to always come off as condescending. She always managed to be up in your shit, yelling at you for nothing.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>    So, the present. I was doing my math homework, listening to "The State Of Massachusetts" by Dropkick Murphys, not expecting to get yelled at. I mean, I was doing my homework. But no, apparently using me as a slave is more important than finishing my homework. It got to the point where the principal of the school was going to keep me after school if I refuse to vacuum in the future. I don't give a shit if my homework is due Tuesday. I'm going to get my homework out of my way. Oh, yeah. By the way, people get paid to do that shit. They're called custodians (or janitors). Granted, they have other shit to deal with. But I have other shit to deal with, too.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>    Oh, yeah. Wanna hear the best part so far? My parents. I told them about this when I got off the bus. The school was supposed to call, but apparently didn't. They were on my side, saying that the school "wasn't going to keep me after school to vacuum". 
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>    God, I seriously hope I'm out of that shithole of a classroom before the end of the month.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>    Update 2019/10/11: The school has admitted that they were in the wrong for making me vacuum. We're starting to get along better.
