            <!--Body Text--><div class="img">
                <p>Well, here we go. Yet another addition to the "why the fuck am I the punching bag" series. You might think I'm milking it at this point, but I'm just trying to get some stuff off of my chest. Anyways, let's go.</p>
                <p>All of my life, I have been the punching bag. The butt of the joke. Now don't get me wrong, I do deserve some of it. Autism shouldn't be an excuse, after all. But the thing I don't understand is why I have to be the one who gets picked at, prodded at, shoved into walls, and so on?</p>
                <p>Simple. I'm an easy fucking target. People love to see me fall. They want to see me fail for some reason. I have no idea why they want to see me fail, but they do. Is it because of me being "gay" in sixth grade (3 fucking years ago)? Is it because of me jerking off to hentai, which is irrelevant? Probably. Is it because I probably did something so long ago that I don't remember? Probably. I just don't fucking know.</p>
                <p>And why am I the only one that gets shit thrown at them? Why don't the other kids with autism get picked on? Why do I have only one true friend? Why is it that I have shit so poorly? And is it even fucking worth it, to live through everything? To worry about shit all the time? Is it worth it being in this body, in these shoes?</p>
                <p>News flash: just like most things, I have no idea. The only reason I haven't given up is because if I were to, I would let down everyone who cared for me. My family, my friends, the people I talk to on Discord would all be upset if I were to kill myself. I would let everyone in my community down. I would let everyone I talk to down. I would probably cause some terrible shit to happen if I were to end it all.</p>
                <p>I've noticed myself becoming a thin-skinned asshole because of this all. Someone who seeks revenge but can't even form an argument. Someone who's incapable of not coming off as weird. Someone who doesn't know who they are or what they will be. And naturally, in a world where people are beaten down all the time for little reason, I'm one of the unlucky ones. Part of a group of people at the bottom of the totem pole, if you will.</p>
                <p>Anyways, I know what you're going to say. "Don't kill yourself. You have so much to live for." Thing is: I don't know if I do or not. Will I grow up to be the next Bill Gates? Will I grow up to be your average office worker? Will I be living under a bridge? In a world where you can only get noticed if you're the first or exceptionally good at something, I might just be your average Joe at a 9-to-5 office job. A nobody. And I don't want to live that way.</p>
