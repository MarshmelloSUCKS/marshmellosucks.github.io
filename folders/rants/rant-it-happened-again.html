        <!--Update--><p class="update">Depression warning: I will talk about stuff that might come off as depressing. If you're one of those that's just going to tell me to "man up", fuck off.</p>

            <p>This is an update to the "Fuck My Life" rant. Please <a href="/folders/rants/rant-fuck-my-life.html">read that one</a> if you haven't. </p>
            <p>Before I rant yet again about how kids in my grade are ignorant as shit, I need to provide some context. Today, I was able to score one of the school's retired projectors and a laptop. When I was storing them in my locker before math (5th period), one of the assholes in my grade noticed. Right then, I knew shit wasn't going to end well.</p>
            <p>Fast forward 2 periods to Phys Ed. As I was changing, several of the assholes apparently heard about it. They started telling me to "project" stuff. I told them to shut the fuck up and they snapped, turning the whole thing into a chaos of yelling.</p>
            <p>This shit continued into Phys Ed. I snapped at them. I wound up sitting out for a few minutes. At about the end of class, I decided to hop back in. At the end of class, the teacher told us to go change.</p>
            <p>In the locker room again, the same shit kept up. They were talking about something and I laughed. They told me to "shut the fuck up" and resumed the chaos of yelling. I snapped and yelled at them to shut the fuck up, apparently causing the Phys Ed teacher to walk in and yell at us. The assholes were standing there like they did nothing. They said that they were throwing shit at me because I was telling them to fuck off (why wouldn't I? I had every fucking reason to). Of course, those guys are hypocritical as all hell. They tell me to fuck off and shut the hell up ALL THE TIME.</p>
            <p>In the end, I did do some stupid shit. Not accepting the offer to change in a different locker room being one of them. However, what I did back in 6th grade does not mean you get to throw shit at me.</p>
            <p>And let me mention another thing. You guys throw shit at me all the time because I watch anime. That's FUCKING IRRELEVANT. Do I watch anime at school? No. Do I jack off in class to hentai? No. Do I constantly mention anything about "what anime I watch" (not like I do watch any)? Fuck no. The only reason you know I'm a weeb is because I've called myself a weeb.</p>
            <p> So, maybe I am in the wrong. At least I have a projector, right? Not even sure if that was worth it. </p>
