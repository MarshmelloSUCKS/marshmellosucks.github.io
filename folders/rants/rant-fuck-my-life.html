        <!--Update--><p class="update">Depression warning: I will talk about stuff that might come off as depressing. If you're one of those that's just going to tell me to "man up", fuck off.</p>
        <!--Body Text--><div class="img">
            <p>    Before I go to Depressionville, I'll provide you with a little story from 6th grade. I used to hang out with a transgender (you can see where this is going, huh?). She influenced me in all of the wrong ways. I "came out" as gay without knowing what the hell I was talking about. I was also a furry at the time, and was super loud about it. I guess you could call me a furfag. Anyways, let's take a ride down to the pits of sadness.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p> So, that was in 6th grade. In 7th grade, I would constantly get called "gay", despite trying to clear my image. In 8th grade, same story. Now I'm in 9th grade. Instead of being a "gay" furry, I'm a straight weeb. I will admit, I am loud about being a weeb. That doesn't mean that you can harass me for shit I did back in 6th geade. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>    So, why am I STILL being called "gay"? Either the 9th and 10th graders at my school are a bunch of ignorant shits that can't tell that I'm not 6th grade me anymore, or they think "all weebs are gay". Seriously, fuck off. You're making me near suicidal because of all of the bullshit that you've been talking about for the past 3 years. I am ready to move on from the way I was back then, but you assholes are preventing me from doing that. Fuck you. 
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>    Fortunately, there are people who aren't like this. It's just a shame they're on Discord. So thank you to those who aren't ignorant. But to those who are, you can go hike up a mountain trail, get frostbite, become numb everywhere, and fall down a cliff or some shit. I want you out of my life more than anything.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>    You're probably asking why I won't get help. After all, it is one call away. My answer would be: I just don't want to. I don't think a therapist would be able to understand what I go through, my thought process, and how I see everything. My parents would also make me feel uncomfortable as all hell throughout the whole process, too. And I could talk about all of this with them. But they either A) wouldn't understand, B) would ground me, or C) not care. And I am not about to lose my only outlet of communication. </p>

            <p></p>
            <p>    So, I guess that's it. It's just a shame that something so small can continue to haunt me. When will I ever be able to clear my reputation? </p>
            <p></p>
        <p>    <b>UPDATE 2019/10/22 13:?? CDT:</b> Assholes did it again. It's mainly the redneck and the all-around asshole that's doing it. <b>This is almost fucking pushing me to suicide.</b> I honestly think people tell me not to kill myself so they can continue to use me as a punching bag. Sorry, but this punching bag might fight back.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>    <b>UPDATE 2019/10/22 22:01 CDT:</b> Wrote an <a href="/folders/rants/rant-hey-asshole.html">open letter</a> to the person who's been throwing shit at me.</p>
