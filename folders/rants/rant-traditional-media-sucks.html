            <p>Let's get straight to the point with this one. Traditional media like Cable TV and radio aren't my first choice of entertainment because there's either no variety or too much variety. With radio, you can hear the same 50 songs on repeat from 12 AM to 11 PM. With TV, you can watch WAY TOO MANY channels, 795/800 you have NO interest in. So, let's break down my issues with traditional media.
            </p>
            <p>Starting out with radio, you likely have at least three types of radio stations. The basic ones are the Top 40s station, the country station, and the rock station. All three play the same selection of 50-150 songs that have been overplayed to the point that you want to throw your stock car radio out of the window and drive into a pole when you hear them. These stations (at least the ones around here) have busted ass request systems so when you try to request a song to be played, it sends you an automated response saying "Thanks for the song, bud!" What it should say is "Thanks for the song, dipshit! We're not actually going to play it because we're too lazy to open up Spotify and stream it." I could set up a bot to message KQNU Q102 every minute to play MK's "17" and they will never play it. 
            </p>
            <p>That, and Christmas is absolutely my least favorite time of year on the radio. Why? You hear the same goddamn Christmas songs that have been on the station's playlist since 1964. Not like it's the same songs you hear wherever you go.
            </p>
            <p>Also, these radio stations could give less of a fuck about what you want. They're in this to profit off of advertisers who pay the station to play their low quality 48kbps MP3 ad twice every commercial break. They always stick to the same commercially produced trashy songs that they think the listeners want.
            </p>
            <p>Anyways, onto Cable. Forget "where do I start", try "what channel do I watch? There's so many of them!" As a 15 y/o who has the ISP's cable box hooked up to their TV, I only use it to watch YouTube videos while I'm playing Minecraft. The only channels I'm interested in are MTV Classic, The Weather Channel, and Game Show Network. So why do I have to pay anywhere from $60-100/mo for hundereds of channels I never even think about tuning into? I only want 4 channels, not 400.
            </p>
            <p>You just gotta love the boomers in this situation. "Them darn kids using the internet instead of watching cable TV and listening to the radio! All they do is stream everything!" We stream everything because we want to control what we listen to. We're sick and tired of radio stations pandering to advertisers rather than listening to the people who actually tune into their stations. We don't want the same song repeated endlessly. We want options. We want variety. And that's  something traditional media fails to offer.</p>
