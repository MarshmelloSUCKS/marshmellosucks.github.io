Get a total of 3 strikes and you will be banned.

I settle all arguments.

This is how banning works. Each time you violate a rule you get a number of strikes (based off the violation) Get 3 strikes in total and you will be banned temporarily for 1 week. Once your ban has expired you will go back down to 1 strike. So if you get another 2 strikes you will be banned again but for 2 weeks that time. Now once that ban expires your strikes will only go back down to 2, so if you get 1 single strike again you will be banned PERMANENTLY.
