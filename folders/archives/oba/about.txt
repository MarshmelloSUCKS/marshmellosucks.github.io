Hey, so if your wondering what this site is all about well I can sum it up in a few points.

I’m the creator of the site, John. But you all know me as OriginalBloodAce. I’m an Indie Developer who is working with a small team I put together. This site will also be part company site, what I mean is I will share exclusive stuff on this site, screenshots, and so forth from our progress. (Don’t expect that to happen often) Now as for the site itself, why did I make this site? Well that’s simple, I wanted a place that my fans from Youtube and Miiverse (Wii U) could chat about Nintendo related things without the annoying Miiverse admins always deleting posts and banning people. Also just a place to share Nintendo News with my fans. So here, I’m the boss and what I say goes. So let me tell you what this site offers shall I.

1: News on gaming will always be posted on the main page. Though I wont post every single bit of news, I have other things to do you know.

2: The Wii U NNID Zone and 3DS Friend Code Zone is for sharing and adding new friends.

3: The Adventures Of Nin-Dragon, is a fictional story created by me, it started on the Miiverse but was moved to this site due to annoying admins.

4: Other areas maybe added to the site in the future and I haven’t the slightest clue what they could be.

So there you have it, a very brief run down of what this site is about.

Remember to keep it fairly clean and if you have any questions feel free to comment and post them, I will reply when I can. All disputes will be settled by myself. I might eventually appoint a 2nd Author/Contributors if needed. So hope you all enjoy the OBAForums. I hope you enjoy your time here on the OBA-Forums!
