      <p align='center'><font face=Times size='5' color=white> Ah, Discord. A gamer's paradise, advertising cross-palatform compatability and many other awesome features. It's no wonder why people love Discord more than Skype. However, Discord's been going down the shitter recently. From being investigated by the FBI due to users discussing robbery and child grooming, to users using the platform to chat about bestiality, Discord is widely misused. But the most damning thing of all is what's going on inside of their offices in San Francisco. </p>
    <p align=center> </p>
    <p align=center> So, to give you a recap of what's going on, an independent journalist posted <a href="https://twitter.com/nickmon1112/status/1092469779137482755">this Twitter thread</a> about users chatting about topics such as bestiality and theft. Along with screenshots of the topics mentioned above, there are also <a href="https://twitter.com/nickmon1112/status/1092473441750523904">screenshots of Discord staff members</a> talking about how "cub porn doesn't violate the Discord ToS". For those who aren't caught up with the furry lingo, cub porn is porn of underage furry characters. Karrdian (head of the Trust and Safety team at Discord) also mentioned in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/aknrs9/another_confirmation_from_an_earlier_message_and/ef6tdah">Reddit post</a> how there's a "grey area" with certain cub content.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p align=center>I'm sorry, what? Yeah, I ain't making that shit up. There is NO GREY AREA WHATSOEVER when it comes to underage porn. NONE WHATSOEVER. And you, allthefoxes. Quit getting your head up your anthro bird's ass and start handling reports of <a href="https://twitter.com/nickmon1112/status/1092471811630088193">ACTUAL PEDOPHILIA</a> correctly!</p>
      <p align=center></p>
      <p align=center>Actually, speaking of allthefoxes. Back in 2013, allthefoxes was demoted from r/gaming for deleting posts criticizing a Twitch staff's decision to add furry emotes to the service <sup>[<a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1r66gy/twitch_drama_uallthefoxes_gets_demodded_from/'>source</a>]</sup>. Another thing about him, a <a href="https://twitter.com/nickmon1112/status/1092880726599573505">screenshot</a> of his F-List account surfaced a while back. In that screenshot, you can see that Mr. Furry Bird here is into "underage" and "younger characters". 
        <p> </p>
        <p align=center>So, this kinda leaves me at the end of this piece. How can Discord improve? Well, they already banned cub content. So, let's follow that up with removing allthefoxes from the staff team. Get him out of Discord's headquarters. Abandon him on the streets. Let him work for McDonalds. Someone who was demoted from a pretty large subreddit should not work for a pretty large chatting platform. Next, I'd do better background checks on your employees. If you had decent background checks, allthefoxes most likely would have not made it onto the staff team. Finally, start handling reports of actual illegal activity better. With how things are going, I really hope Discord gets its act together.</p>
