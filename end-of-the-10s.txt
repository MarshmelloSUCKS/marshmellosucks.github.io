Well, it's the end of the decade as I'm typing this. This past decade has seen many people break through the mold to become that extra someone they didn't have to be, and the people that want to drag you down no matter what you do. I'm going to list what made this decade good for me, and what made it suck.

First off, what made it good. Thank you SO MUCH to Michael Mikey, DJP, Venus, Sf9, Sno, Dupree, and everyone else that has put up with me. Thanks to you guys, I've been able to have an outlet of people to chat with, rant to, and have a good time with. You guys are the fucking best and I wish you all the greatest decade possible.

However, there are others that have made it bad for me. Namely the assholes at school that have decided to beat me to the ground, forcing me to become the introverted, thin-skinned asshole I am. Without you, I might have actually had a good decade. Thank you so much for beating me to the ground for the past 3 years for some stupid bullshit I said in 6th grade. My life would be so much better without you, and I wish you all the fucking worst.

Anyways, what do I plan to do in the next 10 years? I'll be graduating high school in 2023, which means I don't have a lot of time left to decide. I would love to build up my platform to the point where I'm not constantly ignored. I would love to go into web design or cinematography/photography. I'd love to have my own little appartment to myself. And of course, I plan on being alone. Besides that, I honestly have no idea.

Anyways, Happy New Years to all of those who have made my life somewhat tolerable. And those who don't fuck me over. And for those who have messed up my life, I'd love to return the favor.
